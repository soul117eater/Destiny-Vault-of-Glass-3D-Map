Destiny-Vault-of-Glass-3D-Map
=============================

This is going to be a public project for anyone who wants to work on it.

Stylized in a manner similar to the 3D maps in the metroid prime games.

If you have not seen or played metroid prime, look up a few videos of those games on youtube.

Alternatively, look up the map system that it has.

It's highly intuitive, and I hope to have the same intuitive aspects integrated into this project.

This project is going to be done for the destiny game community to view.
